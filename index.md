And now, on to the portfolio...


### Amira Invest

I'm building a marketplace platform that provides the structure and the incentives needed for you to trust the investment opinions you find online.

The project includes over 300 PRs, and 1200 commits with 5 contributors. Follow us here so you can join as we open source components of our app. Sadly, this code is unable to be shared publically yet. But _stay tuned and [follow here](https://github.com/amirainvest)!_ There may be changes soon! ðŸ˜‰

I'm currently working on a recommendation engine which builds a unique model for each user to recommend content of most worth and relevance to each user's feed. This [article](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/01/26/ml-applications/news-feed-ranking/) from Meta's engineering blog will give you a sense of what I'm building.

Join our waitlist at [https://amirainvest.com](https://amirainvest.com) if you're interested in managing your own investments with more confidence! 


### Academy Summarized
I co-authored a [paper](https://github.com/jhirschibar/academia_summarized/blob/main/Arxiv_Transformer.pdf) with colleagues at GaTech where we analyzed the effects of fine-tuning an encoder-decoder transformer on State-of-the-art pretrained models using Arxiv academic paper data. We found that by extracting significant sentances from the papers, we could auto-generate summaries/abstacts better than with the non-fine-tuned version.

Below is our abstract

### Music Box: a better Spotify playlist generator
I co-authored a poster with a team at GaTech that built an app to generate better Spotify playlists using clustering algorithms. Read about or contribute to the project [here](https://github.com/jhirschibar/music_box), or try out the app in your browser [here](https://out-of-the-music-box.herokuapp.com/)

Here is a pic of the UI from the app. Click here for the full [poster](https://github.com/jhirschibar/music_box/blob/main/team065poster.pdf):

### Scratch ML: Machine Learning Algorithms written from scratch
[Here](https://github.com/jhirschibar/scratch_ml) is where I've been collecting tools (algorithms) I've built completely from scratch as an exercise to make sure I understand them. 

Initial efforts start with only using numpy and python. Once the foundations are established, I will later make use of PyTorch or other tools to build out other tools. This is a new work in progress (idea came over a year ago, which I'm just barely picking back up). 

Give a follow, or DM me if you'd like to contribute. It'd be sweet to get a out-of-the-box, easy to use set of Machine Learning tools prepped into a PyPi package that learners could experiment with. 
## Thanks for READingMe!
