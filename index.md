### Academy Summarized
I co-authored a paper with colleagues at GaTech where we analyzed the effects of fine-tuning an encoder-decoder transformer on State-of-the-art pretrained models using Arxiv data. We found that by extracting significant sentances from the papers, we could auto-generate summaries/abstacts better than with the non-fine-tuned version.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jhirschibar/jhirschibar/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
